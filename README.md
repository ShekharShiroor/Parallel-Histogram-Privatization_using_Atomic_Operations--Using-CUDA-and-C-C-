# Parallel-Histogram-(Privatization_using_Atomic_Operations)-Using-CUDA-and-C/C++

This program is my class assignment for CSC 196U at Sac State. The program demonstrates Parallel Histogram Using CUDA and C/C++.

The program uses shared memory and Privatization (atomic operations) for optimized memory access to/form the GPU's global memory. This improves the histogram counting process very much.
